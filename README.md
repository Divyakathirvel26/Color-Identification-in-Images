# Color-Identification-in-Images
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Simple isnâ€™t it? Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color names.
Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255.The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.
